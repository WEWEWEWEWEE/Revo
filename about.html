        <h2>
            Established in the early 1990s, our hospital has grown from a small clinic in Colombo to a leading healthcare institution in Sri Lanka. With a vision to provide world-class medical care, we began in Bambalapitiya, quickly becoming known for our commitment to quality and patient-centered care. Over the years, we expanded our services to meet the diverse healthcare needs of our community, launching specialized departments such as cardiology, oncology, and neurology in the early 2000s.In 2010, we opened our specialized treatment branch in Kandy, further solidifying our reputation for medical excellence. Today, with multiple branches and over 200 dedicated professionals, we offer a comprehensive range of services, from routine check-ups to complex surgeries. Our commitment to innovation, research, and continuous improvement drives us to adopt the latest medical advancements and provide exceptional care. As we look to the future, we remain dedicated to expanding our services and enhancing the health and well-being of the communities we serve, building on our legacy as one of Sri Lankaâ€™s most trusted medical institutions.
